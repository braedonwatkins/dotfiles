# TODO Document

This is my document to track things I want in nvim.  
I can't keep interrupting my day trying to figure out the keycombo or plugin necessary to get the functionality I need.

This will be a living document to iterate on as time goes on.

## Better Insert Mode Options

### Jumping Words

## Better Git Functionality

### Better merge conflict resolution TUI

## Harpoon Improvements

## Harpoon-Like Notes Buffer

### Project Dependent?

## Color Preview

## Tag Autoclose

In JSX, HTML, and Svelte when I open a tag I want it to populate the closing tag already like how most VSCode setups do...

## SHpotify stable branch (make my own??)

## Better Insert Mode Movements

### ctrl arrow to move words while typing

### ctrl backspace to delete word

### cmd arrow to move lines

### cmd backspace to delete lines
