# TODO Document

This is my document to track things I want in nvim. I can't keep interrupting
my day trying to figure out the keycombo or plugin necessary to get the
functionality I need.

This will be a living document to iterate on as time goes on.

## json formatter

## debugger

need one folks... look at `nvim-dap` and `nvim-dap-ui`

## yml

is there a yml formatter / linter?

## lualine

sometimes it feels like a lot of mental effort (esp on big screens) to find lualine at the bottom of the screen

that said, i think it's weird to have it always on top... maybe theres a nice way to toggle

## oil & harpoon

Everyone said oil and water dont mix but have you heard of oil and harpoon?
Anyways...

When in the oil menu harpoon shortcuts dont seem to work. Need to look into
this.

## surround improvement

Be able to surround (<leader>cs) with arbitrary syntax like try catch or a
function call

## autocomplete selection

I have it set to enter to select a suggestion (fine). However, I only want that
enter to select a suggestion when I have the autocomplete focused (tab)

## Fugitive Jump Sections

## Python

### Formatting

"Formatters not available..."

### loading time

For some reason when I open python files now they take like 2-3s to load...
what gives??

### library autocomplete & autoimport

I want autocomplete for library functions like `os.path` or `json.dumps`

## Better Insert Mode Options

### Jumping Words

## Better Git Functionality

### GitLens equivalent i.e. follow git blames

### Better merge conflict resolution TUI

## Harpoon Improvements

## Harpoon Queue

## Fix keybindings for my keyboard

## Harpoon-Like Notes Buffer

### Project Dependent?

## Auto-Update Imports

## Telescope Search Hidden Files

## Color Preview

## Tag Autoclose

In JSX, HTML, and Svelte when I open a tag I want it to populate the closing
tag already like how most VSCode setups do...

## SHpotify stable branch (make my own??)

## Better Insert Mode Movements

### ctrl arrow to move words while typing

### ctrl backspace to delete word

### cmd arrow to move lines

### cmd backspace to delete lines
